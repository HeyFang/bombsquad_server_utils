    <p>Grab some friends, your PC, a few gamepads or phones, and get your party-game on!

Challenge your friends or the computer to a plethora of mini-games including Capture-the-Flag, King-of-the-Hill, Bomber-Hockey, and of course Epic-Slow-Motion-Elimination.

Laugh gleefully as you land a perfectly-thrown sticky-bomb squarely on an opponent's face, freeze them with an ice bomb and shatter them to bits with a punch, or just pick them up and toss them off a nearby cliff. BombSquad's rag doll physics based gameplay ensures that every confrontation leads to a unique (and often hilarious) outcome.

    Up to 8 players can get in on the action on a single Mac through BombSquad's support of keyboards, USB gamepads, Wiimotes, PS3 controllers, and XBox 360 controllers. You can even use Android devices, iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads as controllers via 'BombSquad Remote', a free app available on the iOS App Store/Google Play Store.

Bombs Away!
